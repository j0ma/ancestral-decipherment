# Ancestral word linkage

Given data in two _diasporic languages_ with a shared ancestor, how can we find words that are linked together?

Step 1: Methodology
- Baselines
    - Dict join
    - Dict join + add word list ("Hebrew-derived terms")
    - Transliterate + edit distance

Step 2: How can we do this _well_, _portably_ and _fast_?
